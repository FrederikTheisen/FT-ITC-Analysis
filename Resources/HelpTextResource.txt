## About \appname
\appname is a macOS application for processing, analyzing, and presenting isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. It takes you from raw instrument traces (power vs time), through baseline correction and peak integration, to model-based fitting. The app supports single-experiment fitting and global fitting across multiple experiments. It also includes utilities for planning experiments (\designer), combining tandem experiments (\merger), and generating publication-style figures and exports.
# \appname focuses on:
- **Baseline correction and peak integration** with per-injection control.
- **Standard and advanced fitting workflows**, including global fitting with optional constraints.
- **Further analysis**, \appname provides derived analysis schemes for appropriate data sets.
- **Workflow utilities** (\designer, \merger, and export tools) to support planning, analysis, and reporting.

## Getting Started
When you open the app, you will see a dialog indicating that no data is loaded. The sections below provide a quick start guide; scroll down for more detailed descriptions of each part of the app.
# Adding Data
Press **\space** to open a file browser, navigate to your ITC data files, and open them.
# Processing
Go to the **Process Data** tab and start by selecting a baseline mode. Each mode has its own options. As a starting point, use the polynomial baseline and increase the degree if the baseline fit is poor.
When you are satisfied with the baseline, review the peak integration options. Start by selecting **\peakfit**, which typically chooses reasonable integration regions for all injections.
You can select individual injections and adjust the integration range by dragging the blue range markers.
# Analysis
Go to the **Analyze Data** tab and press **SPACE** to automatically fit the standard one-set-of-sites model using the Simplex algorithm.
If you need a different model, select it and then click the appropriate fit button for the solver you want to use.
If you have processed multiple data sets, you can enable **\multexp** to fit multiple experiments together, with or without constraints. Global fitting produces an *Analysis Results* item that can be inspected for additional insight.
Use the **residual plot** to evaluate fit quality. Residuals highlight systematic deviations (for example, baseline bias, integration issues, or model mismatch) that may not be obvious from the fitted curve alone.
# Presentation
Go to the **Final Figure** tab and adjust the display options using the menus just below the tab bar. Export the figure(s) using the button in the top-right corner of the figure view.

## Reading Data Files
# Compatible Formats
\appname can read **MicroCal / Malvern Panalytical** and **TA Instruments NanoAnalyze Export** files.
# Loading Files
Drag a compatible file into the app window.
Alternatively, use **File > Open…** and select the file you want to analyze. You can also press **\enter** to open the file browser or press **\space** to load the most recently opened file.
# \merger
Some workflows involve **tandem experiments**, where one titration immediately follows another and the combined sequence should be treated as a single dataset (for example, sequential titrations that are intended to form one continuous experiment).
The tool combines tandem experiments into a single merged entry for downstream processing and analysis, while keeping the original inputs available.
# Saving Files
\appname can save processed experiments in the `.ftitc` format. The saved file contains everything needed to reopen, reprocess, and refit the experiment, including fitting results. It does not currently store downstream analyses such as Spolar–Record or protonation analysis results.

## Processing Experimental Data
# Adjusting the Baseline
\appname provides two different baseline correction modes.
**Spline baseline**  
This mode estimates the baseline level for each injection delay period and interpolates a spline between these points. You can use custom spline handle modes for additional manual control. Additional points can be added anywhere for complete control.
**Polynomial baseline with outlier rejection**  
This mode is more robust to spikes and baseline artifacts, but it may perform poorly for interactions with slow kinetics or very short injection delays. You can convert a polynomial baseline to a spline baseline using the `>` button next to the baseline mode selector.
# Setting the Integration Range
The integration range is defined by the start time and the stop delay. By default, integration starts at the injection time and continues through most of the injection delay. To reduce integrated noise, shorten the integration length.

\appname provides three options for setting the integration end point:
- **Time:** Set the integration end time directly.
- **Factor:** Set an integration length based on peak height.
- **\peakfit:** Fit an exponential function to each peak.

You can double-click or select injections in the injection list to set integration limits per injection. You can also drag the integration range markers to adjust them. Press **\space** to copy the select injection integration range to the next peak.
# Setting Experiment Attributes
If you perform experiments under different conditions, register those conditions as experiment attributes (for example, buffer identity and salt concentration). These attributes enable downstream analyses and comparisons across experiments.
You can also note concentration errors. This information can improve uncertainty estimates for fitted parameters.

## Analyzing Experiments
# Fitting Your Experiment
In most cases, you can analyze an experiment by clicking the **\btnfit** button on the analysis page. The app includes multiple models to support different interaction mechanisms.
# Residual Plot
The residual plot shows the difference between the observed integrated heats and the values predicted by the current fit. A good fit typically produces residuals that fluctuate around zero without clear structure. Use the residual plot to:
# Global Fitting
\appname can perform global fits of multiple experiments simultaneously. To enable global fitting, select the This is useful for difficult interactions and for applying constraints across experiments (for example, shared parameters). Global fitting stores its output as a new result object. If you have experiments at multiple temperatures, global fitting can be used to estimate the heat capacity change upon binding, which is often useful for thermodynamic interpretation.
# Further Analysis
After a global fit completes, a result view becomes available in the sidebar. There you can inspect fitted parameters and parameter correlations.
Additional analyses are available, such as evaluating temperature dependence to derive global thermodynamic parameters across experiments. These options are available if the fitted data covers appropriate variable ranges (eg temperature range).

## Presenting the Data
# Final Figure
\appname can export publication-style figures from the **Final Figure view**. Use the three menus at the top of the view to adjust styling and layout.
The displayed dimensions apply to the plot area only; they do not include space required for axis labels and legends. You can unify axes to use consistent axis limits across all currently active experiments.
# Export Options
\appname provides tools export data points (File > Export). It is possible to export **raw power-vs-time traces** for one or more experiments and **integrated heats per injection**. 
Several predefined export formats are available. These formats may include metadata. For the CSV export format, the exported data can be defined in Preferences > Export.

## Optimizing Your Experiment
# \designer
The \designer helps you plan an ITC experiment before you collect data. Use it to explore how choices such as cell concentration, syringe concentration, injection volumes, and the number of injections affect the expected titration curve and the information content of the experiment.
# The Sample
ITC does not require labeling, but it does require careful sample preparation and reliable concentration determination for accurate modeling.
Remove bubbles before loading and consider **degassing** samples (vacuum degassing is common; high G centrifugation can also help reduce bubbles). Buffer mismatch between syringe and cell can produce large dilution heats that distort the baseline and bias fitted parameters.
Degassing steps should be **done at the experimental temperature** to avoid later release of gas due to temperature changes.
# Buffer Mismatch
Buffer mismatch is often visible as unexpectedly large heats that do not disappear upon saturation of the binding partner in the cell. Offsets larger than ±10 kJ/mol can be consistent with buffer mismatch, depending on the system.
Reducing agents can be particularly problematic. Avoid DTT when possible; consider alternatives such as TCEP.
# Concentrations
ITC experiments are highly concentration dependent. Consider stoichiometry, cell volume, and syringe concentration when designing an experiment. For one-to-one binding, a typical goal is to be at equal syringe to cell concentrations around the middle of the titration to obtain good baselines both before and after the transition region. This can be roughly estimated by calculating the concentration of the titrant molecule diluted into the cell volume. For MicroCal style instruments, you would typically want a syringe concentration around 10x of the concentration in the cell.
Higher concentrations produce larger heats and steeper transitions. For high-affinity interactions (\kd < 50 nM), the transition can become too sharp to fit reliably unless sufficient signal and curvature are present. Increasing temperature can sometimes help by weakening binding and often increasing heat magnitude.

## Interpreting Your Data
Affinity interpretation is often straightforward, but many parameters are temperature dependent. Compare only when experiments were performed at similar temperatures.
# Thermodynamic Parameters
ITC directly measures binding enthalpy and affinity, allowing entropy to be derived via the Gibbs free energy. Entropy is often used as a proxy for conformational ordering, but it contains multiple contributions, including hydration effects that can be large and favorable. Measuring the heat capacity change upon binding enables more detailed thermodynamic interpretation.
# Analysis of Structuring
The level of structuring can be inferred from thermodynamic parameters using the Spolar–Record method. This requires estimating the heat capacity change upon binding from experiments across a temperature range. The method allows estimation of surface desolvation and the corresponding desolvation entropy, which can then be separated from the total entropy to obtain a term that more directly reflects conformational entropy changes upon binding.
# Electrostatics Analysis
The ionic-strength dependence of a protein–protein interaction affinity provides information about charge–charge contributions. By measuring the dissociation constant (\kd) at different ionic strengths, it is possible to estimate effective charges and characteristic length scales of the interaction. This can help interpret binding mechanisms and guide strategies to modulate or disrupt interactions.
# Protonation Analysis
If binding involves proton transfer, using buffers with different protonation enthalpies can reveal and quantify this contribution. By comparing binding enthalpies measured in different buffers, you can assess whether proton transfer accompanies binding. Quantification is typically performed by fitting the dependence of observed binding enthalpy on buffer protonation enthalpy. \appname supports this workflow by allowing buffer attributes to be assigned to experiments.
